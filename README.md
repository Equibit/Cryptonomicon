1. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in these rules are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## Process

1. All players must unanimously agree to all rule changes #virtual
1. All changes to the game MUST be submitted through a pull request (PR)
1. All changes to the game SHOULD be vetted by submitting a CIP or delta [issue](https://github.com/Equibit/Cryptonomicon/issues).
    1. A CIP is a Cryptonomicon Improvement Proposal (analogous to a BIP in Bitcoin Core). 
    1. A delta is an inconsistency between a specification and an observation (analogous to a bug in software). 
    1. If any player breaks the rules or witnesses another player breaking the rules, they SHOULD file a delta report.
    1. Deltas SHOULD be reviewed by the Executors to determine whether the rule should be changed or the player should be sanctioned.
